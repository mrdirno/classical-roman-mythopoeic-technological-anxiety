## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a common household 'numina' device (a self-heating bath, a singing mosaic) malfunctions, revealing the trapped spirit's anguish and history.
- Create a journal entry from a Pontiff arguing for the ethical capture of a new class of 'industrial numina' to power a massive public project, and the dissent it causes.
- Draft a myth or 'origin story' told by the engineers/placators about the first time humans bound a spirit to matter, and what was lost in the bargain.
- Describe the moment a character, for the first time, hears the collective 'hum' or 'song' of all the bound spirits in Rome, and understands the true scale of its suffering.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a 'numina schematic' for a simple artifact (e.g., an Ever-Burning Lamp). Include a diagram, the type of spirit bound, the binding ritual, and potential failure modes.
- Propose a 'theological-philosophical' framework for the ethics of Numina Materia. Create a set of rules or principles for its use, debated by different factions within the story.
